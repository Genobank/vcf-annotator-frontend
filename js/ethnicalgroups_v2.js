Currently the Huicholes live in the Sierra Madre Occidental, in the states of Jalisco, Nayarit, Zacatecas and Durango. The elements that distinguish this population are their clothing, crafts and cosmogony in which corn, deer and peyote play an important role.

During the Mexican revolution, the region suffered from epidemics, hunger and forest exploitation which forced the Mixtecs to look for economic alternatives for their survival. One solution was migration and in 1944 the “laborer program” allowed massive migrations to the USA. From that moment to this day, migratory routes extended all the way to Canada and alaska. </p> <p> Mixtec language belongs to the otomangue family.

The Mixtec region has a huge variety in microclimates which allowed the Mesoamerican Mixtec villages to commerce food and handicrafts. They also had strong social, cultural and political ties that are known thanks to their pictographic writing.

The first Jesuit missions would find Tarahumaras, Chinipas, Guarijios, Cocoyomes and Guazapares in the area but the missioners identified them all as Tarahumaras. The evangelization of the native tribes was not the only reason missioners stayed in the area as they were interested in recruiting workers for mining centers.

    "TRIQUI": {
        "description" : "<p> Triqui history begins in Monte Alban, from where they were expelled. They settled in Oaxaca, where we can find them up to this day. Due to the linguistic similarities with the Mixtec language, they may have had a common origin 2,000 years before the present and then diverged into the modern linguistic variants that we know today. During the XV century, Triquis and Mixtecs were reigned by the Mexicas until the arrival of the Spaniards. When the conquest began, the Triqui people achieved syncretism in their cosmogony with Catholicism. </p> <p> Agriculture is the main source for their economic growth. One of the main crops is coffee which is cultivated with collective work from the community. In recent times, migration has become another source of income not only to USA or Canada, but also to other states such as Mexico State, Sinaloa and Baja California.  </p> <p> Triqui society has a strong family connection which means that the land ownership is communitarian and there are strict rules about accessing it even for agricultural purposes.

    "NAHUA_OTOMI": {
        "description" : "<p>Nahuas Description.</p> <p>Nahua people have in common their language. The word Nahua comes from the verb “nahuatli” which means “to speak clearly”. according to their oral tradition, they came from a marshy land called aztlan. The location of aztlan is unknown to this day. In 1325 they founded Tenochtitlan and had a huge influence in the modern states of Guerrero, Hidalgo, Morelos, Michoacan, Puebla, San Luis Potosi, Veracruz and Tabasco. When the Spaniards arrived to america, the Nahua empire had settlements in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Central America. They are also known as Pipiles in Guatemala and el Salvador or Nicaraos in Nicaragua. </p> <p> The origins of the Nahua people go back to the pilgrimage from aztlan. During the XII century, hunter-gatherers migrated to the south of the american continent. This migratory wave is known as Coixca. When they reached the modern state of Morelos, they divided in several groups. Some of them reached Guerrero (700 years before the present), Michoacan and other states from western Mexico. The settlement in the modern state of Mexico, thrived during the XII and XII centuries, after the fall of the Toltec empire. In that settlement Tenochtitlan, Tlacotalpan and Texcoco were founded. These lordships were known as the Triple Alliance which would reign over 100 years in Mesoamerica until the arrival of the Spaniards.  </p> <p> The Nahua language belongs to the Yuto-Aztec or Yuto-Nahua linguistic family. Nahua is spoken all the way from south USAA to Nicaragua. In Mexico, it is spoken in 11 states, which makes it the most spoken yuto-aztec language. It is classified as eastern, western, central and northern Nahua.  </p> <div class = 'textCenter'> <img src='https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/geneticroots/etnias/Nahua1-min.jpg' width='180' />\n<img src='https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/geneticroots/etnias/Nahua_2-min.jpg' width='180' />\n</div>  <p> Otomi Description. </p> <p> Otomi people can be found in the modern states of Hidalgo, Mexico State, Queretaro, Michoacan, Guanajuato and Tlaxcala. The word otomi comes from the nahuatl language and it means “the one that walks with arrows”. This native american group was present when the great Mesoamerican civilizations thrived in places such as Teotihuacan and Tula. It is also possible that they had influence in the Mexica civilization.  </p> <p> When the Spaniards arrived to Mexico, the Otomi people were under the orders of the Triple Alliance. At that time the languages that were spoken were not only nahuatl, but also otomi, chocho, matlatzinca and mazahua. During the early colonization, the otomi culture was studied by the Franciscan order. Thanks to their work we have written records of their culture and language, such as the Huamantla codex and the Huichapan codex. During the time of the Mexican independence, the otomi people helped the insurgent fraction to gain back the lands that were taken from them. When war ceased, they were stripped away from their lands.  </p> <p> Nowadays, Otomi speakers have diminished due to migration and urbanization but recent attempts to recover their identity, language and culture have been introduced in their communities. A clear example is the town of Ixmiquilpan, Hidalgo, where elementary schools are now teaching “hñahñü” as a second language. The Otomi language belongs to the Otomangue family and has four regional divisions, depending on the geographical site where it is spoken: western, eastern, northern or southern. </p> <div class = 'textCenter'> <img src='https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/geneticroots/etnias/Otomi_1-min.png' width='180' />\n</div>",
