The word Nahua comes from the verb “nahuatli” which means “to speak clearly”. according to their oral tradition, they came from a marshy land called aztlan. The location of aztlan is unknown to this day. In 1325 they founded Tenochtitlan and had a huge influence in the modern states of Guerrero, Hidalgo, Morelos, Michoacan, Puebla, San Luis Potosi, Veracruz and Tabasco. When the Spaniards arrived to america, the Nahua empire had settlements in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Central America. They are also known as Pipiles in Guatemala and el Salvador or Nicaraos in Nicaragua. </p> <p> The origins of the Nahua people go back to the pilgrimage from aztlan. During the XII century, hunter-gatherers migrated to the south of the american continent. This migratory wave is known as Coixca. When they reached the modern state of Morelos, they divided in several groups. Some of them reached Guerrero (700 years before the present), Michoacan and other states from western Mexico. The settlement in the modern state of Mexico, thrived during the XII and XII centuries, after the fall of the Toltec empire. In that settlement Tenochtitlan, Tlacotalpan and Texcoco were founded. These lordships were known as the Triple Alliance which would reign over 100 years in Mesoamerica until the arrival of the Spaniards.  </p> <p> The Nahua language belongs to the Yuto-Aztec or Yuto-Nahua linguistic family. Nahua is spoken all the way from south USAA to Nicaragua. In Mexico, it is spoken in 11 states, which makes it the most spoken yuto-aztec language.

The word otomi comes from the nahuatl language and it means “the one that walks with arrows”. This native american group was present when the great Mesoamerican civilizations thrived in places such as Teotihuacan and Tula. It is also possible that they had influence in the Mexica civilization.  </p> <p> When the Spaniards arrived to Mexico, the Otomi people were under the orders of the Triple Alliance. At that time the languages that were spoken were not only nahuatl, but also otomi, chocho, matlatzinca and mazahua. During the early colonization, the otomi culture was studied by the Franciscan order. Thanks to their work we have written records of their culture and language, such as the Huamantla codex and the Huichapan codex. During the time of the Mexican independence, the otomi people helped the insurgent fraction to gain back the lands that were taken from them. When war ceased, they were stripped away from their lands.  </p> <p> Nowadays, Otomi speakers have diminished due to migration and urbanization but recent attempts to recover their identity, language and culture have been introduced in their communities. A clear example is the town of Ixmiquilpan, Hidalgo, where elementary schools are now teaching “hñahñü” as a second language.

The figurines that appear in the earth when plowing or when it rains are for this village ancestral test that left their ancestors. Although they explain their origin in their worldview, the Zapotecs, unlike other Mesoamerican groups, had no tradition or legend about their migration.\n</p>\n<p>\n The region of the Isthmus in the Mesoamerican era was part of an important trade route for the Mexicas to trade with Central America, so there were many wars to achieve commercial and military domination of the area against the Zapotecs. The solution to mediate the conflicts was to make a Zapotec-Mexica alliance by marriage between the daughter of Ahuizotl (Emperor Mexica) and Cosijoesa (Zapotec King) in 1497. When the Spaniards arrived, the Zapotecs were stripped of their territory and from that At the time, there have been several clashes, some of them were:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nIn 1660 there was a rebellion in Tehuantepec against Spanish rule, but after a year it was put down.\n</ li>\n<li>\nIn 1823, the Federal Congress decreed the creation of the province of the Isthmus. On this occasion there were conflicts between the Creoles who wanted the land and salt mines for their benefit and the Indians, who believed that the land would be theirs.\n</ li>\n<li>\nIn 1853 there was a movement with Gregorio Meléndez at the head to make free territory to this area, because the rights of the Indians were not respected.\n</ li>\n<li>\nIn 1856, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec became part of Oaxaca once the agreement that considered it as federal territory was annulled.\n</ li>\n</ ul>\n<p>\nThese clashes over the Isthmus have several reasons: fertile lands, fishing and salt-mining areas, the connection between the Pacific and the Atlantic and its diverse terrestrial, maritime and railway communication. Currently, there are 126 ejidos and agrarian communities in the Isthmus, most of the land is used for agriculture and only 14 ejidos are dedicated to livestock.

Approximately 3,500 years ago they had their cultural apogee and they are attributed the construction of the area of Monte Alban and a great religious center in Mitla. They had cultural affinity with the Olmecs, ancient Mayans, Mexicas and Toltecs.
